## Project Status

We want to be transparent about our current project status. Due to some miscommunication, a few parts of our project are not yet fully integrated. We are actively working to resolve these issues during the testing phase. Unfortunately, one of our team members faced a laptop breakdown and had to use our shared laptop to implement a critical functionality. Your understanding and patience during this time are greatly appreciated.
