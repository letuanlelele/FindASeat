Hi Brian,

## Emulator Setup

To provide you with the best information, here are the details of our Android emulator setup:

- **Emulator Version:** Pixel 2 API 24

<meta-data
    android:name="com.google.android.geo.API_KEY"
    android:value="AIzaSyBZwfBY8CkpD05pli49Jwu9GBuCkWz_MTE P"></meta-data>

## Project Status

We want to be transparent about our current project status. Due to miscommunication, a few parts of our project still need to be fully integrated. We are actively working to resolve these issues during the testing phase. Unfortunately, one of our team members faced a laptop breakdown and had to use our laptop to implement her functionalities, which reduced the time we could work on the project. Your understanding and patience during this time are greatly appreciated.
